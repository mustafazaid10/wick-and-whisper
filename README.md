# Wick & Whisper — Luxury Candle Brand Website

> A fully hand-coded, responsive website for a fictional artisan candle brand — built with **HTML & CSS only**.

I designed and developed this site to showcase how digital experiences can evoke calm, luxury, and intention — just like a hand-poured soy candle.

Perfect for candle makers, wellness brands, and slow-living entrepreneurs who want a website that feels like a deep breath.
